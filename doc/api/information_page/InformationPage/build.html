  <p>Describes the part of the user interface represented by this widget.</p>
<p>The framework calls this method when this widget is inserted into the tree
in a given <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BuildContext-class.html">BuildContext</a> and when the dependencies of this widget change
(e.g., an <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/InheritedWidget-class.html">InheritedWidget</a> referenced by this widget changes). This
method can potentially be called in every frame and should not have any side
effects beyond building a widget.</p>
<p>The framework replaces the subtree below this widget with the widget
returned by this method, either by updating the existing subtree or by
removing the subtree and inflating a new subtree, depending on whether the
widget returned by this method can update the root of the existing
subtree, as determined by calling <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Widget/canUpdate.html">Widget.canUpdate</a>.</p>
<p>Typically implementations return a newly created constellation of widgets
that are configured with information from this widget's constructor and
from the given <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BuildContext-class.html">BuildContext</a>.</p>
<p>The given <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BuildContext-class.html">BuildContext</a> contains information about the location in the
tree at which this widget is being built. For example, the context
provides the set of inherited widgets for this location in the tree. A
given widget might be built with multiple different <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BuildContext-class.html">BuildContext</a>
arguments over time if the widget is moved around the tree or if the
widget is inserted into the tree in multiple places at once.</p>
<p>The implementation of this method must only depend on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the fields of the widget, which themselves must not change over time,
and</li>
<li>any ambient state obtained from the <code>context</code> using
<a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BuildContext/dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType.html">BuildContext.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a widget's <a href="../../information_page/InformationPage/build.html">build</a> method is to depend on anything else, use a
<a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html">StatefulWidget</a> instead.</p>
<p>See also:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget-class.html">StatelessWidget</a>, which contains the discussion on performance considerations.</li>

              This category refers to individuals whose BMI falls below 16 kg&#47;m².
              Severe undernourishment indicates a critical deficiency in body weight relative to height, suggesting significant malnutrition.
              People in this category may exhibit severe symptoms of malnutrition, including extreme weight loss, muscle wasting, and potential organ dysfunction.
              Immediate medical attention and nutritional intervention are typically required to address severe undernourishment and prevent further health complications.

              Individuals falling within the BMI range of 16 to 16.9 kg&#47;m² are classified as having medium undernourishment.
              While not as severe as &quot;severe undernourishment,&quot; medium undernourishment still indicates a notable deficiency in body weight relative to height.
              People in this category may experience symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and compromised immune function due to insufficient nutrition.
              Intervention strategies may include dietary improvements, nutritional supplementation, and medical monitoring to address medium undernourishment and prevent its progression.

              This category encompasses individuals with BMIs ranging from 17 to 18.4 kg&#47;m².
              Slight undernourishment suggests a mild deficiency in body weight relative to height.
              While not as critical as severe or medium undernourishment, individuals in this category may still be at risk of health issues associated with inadequate nutrition.
              Dietary counseling, nutritional support, and lifestyle modifications may be recommended to address slight undernourishment and promote healthier weight management.

            title: &#39;Normal nutrition state&#39;,
            description: &quot;&quot;&quot;
              The BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 kg&#47;m² is considered the normal nutrition state.
              Individuals within this range typically have a balanced weight relative to their height, indicating adequate nutrition and a lower risk of weight-related health issues.
              Maintaining a BMI within this range is associated with optimal health outcomes and reduced risk of chronic diseases.
              However, it&#39;s essential to note that BMI is just one measure of health, and other factors such as muscle mass, body composition, and overall lifestyle also contribute to overall health and well-being.

            title: &#39;Overweight&#39;,
            description: &quot;&quot;&quot;
              Falling within the BMI range of 25 to 29.9 kg&#47;m² classifies individuals as overweight.
              Overweight individuals have excess body weight relative to their height, which may increase their risk of developing various health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.
              Weight management strategies, including dietary modifications, regular physical activity, and behavior changes, are typically recommended to reduce the risk of complications associated with being overweight.

          _buildCategory(
            title: &#39;Obesity&#39;,
            description: &quot;&quot;&quot;
              BMI values ranging from 30 to 39.9 kg&#47;m² indicate obesity.
              Obesity is a chronic medical condition characterized by excessive body fat accumulation, which can significantly impact health and increase the risk of numerous diseases and health conditions.
              Individuals with obesity may experience a range of health issues, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea, and joint problems.
              Management of obesity often requires comprehensive interventions, including lifestyle modifications, dietary changes, physical activity, behavioral therapy, and in some cases, medical or surgical interventions.

              This category includes individuals with a BMI exceeding 40 kg&#47;m².
              Pathological obesity represents extreme obesity and is associated with a significantly higher risk of severe health complications and mortality.
              People in this category may experience severe obesity-related health issues such as heart disease, stroke, respiratory problems, and reduced life expectancy.
              Treatment for pathological obesity often involves intensive medical management, including specialized weight loss interventions, close medical monitoring, and, in some cases, bariatric surgery to reduce weight and mitigate associated health risks.
